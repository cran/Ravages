v0.1.2:
 - Parallelisation of SKAT on continuous phenotypes

 - Minor bugs corrected :
   - SKAT() with continuous phenotypes can be run only if at least 2 variants in the genomic region
   - Cleaning temporary files in functions called by mclapply to optimise memory usage

 - Checks added in multiple functions to verify the fit between functions and arguments
